# Chat Server and Client
This project is a threaded web server that can respond to HTTP and WebSocket requests following the appropriate protocols. The web client is an HTML and JavaScript application that allows users to join a chat room. Additionally, there is an Android app client that can send WebSocket requests. Both the web client and Android app client can engage in chat conversations within a room, facilitated by the server, which appropriately responds to requests and sends messages to participants within the same room.
## Steps Involved
